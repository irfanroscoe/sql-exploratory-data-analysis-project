# Sales Analytics Data Modelling & EDA Project

This project builds a clean, analysis-ready dimensional model for a retail sales environment.  
Using customer, product, and sales datasets, the project produces a structured **star schema** suitable for BI dashboards, reporting, and downstream analytics.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design and prepare a high-quality analytics dataset using principles commonly used in business intelligence and data warehousing:

- Dimensional modeling (fact and dimension tables)
- Data cleaning & standardization
- Joining datasets into a unified schema
- Enabling sales performance insights (customer behavior, product trends, revenue patterns)

This dataset can be used as the foundation for Power BI dashboards, SQL analysis, or machine learning experiments.

## 🧱 Data Model (Star Schema)

**Fact Table**
- `fact_sales`  
  Contains transactional-level sales information such as order dates, quantities, prices, and revenue.

**Dimension Tables**
- `dim_products`  
  Contains product attributes including category, subcategory, product line, and cost.

- `dim_customers`  
  Contains customer demographics such as name, location, gender, marital status, and birthdate.
